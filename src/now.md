## Dec 2024

- Reading [The Silmarillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion).
- Working on [threshold optimization](/posts/adaptive_threshold).
- Improving multi-lingual search quality by finetuning [BGE-M3](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3). Spoiler: It was a huge pain :angry: :angry:.
- Overhauled [my homepage](http://ltdk.me). I like the simplicity of [the new theme](https://github.com/CondensedMilk7/eleventy-academic-template).
    - Also added [vale](https://vale.sh/) to my workflow.
    - Decoupled the deployment of [lora](https://ltdk-lora.netlify.app/) from the homepage.
