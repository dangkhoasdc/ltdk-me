# 2025

## Sep

- The new requirement from Google for apps to publish to store, i.e, [supporting 16kb page size](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes) took me several days to figure out.
- During PR review, I need to revise the current C4 diagram & sequence diagrams of the new service. Previously I used [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) for drawing, but later found [planttext](https://www.planttext.com) is much better.
- Studied [spectral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory) and its applications in ML such as [spectral clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering), Graph SVM, and recommendation.
- Studied [queueing theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory) for computer system performance analysis.
- Read:
  - [Linear Algebra for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201643974-linear-algebra-for-data-science-machine-learning-and-signal-processing)
  - [The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/430782.The_Art_of_Computer_Systems_Performance_Analysis?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_31)
  - [Queueing Systems, Volume 1: Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2298875.Queueing_Systems_Volume_1?ref=nav_sb_ss_2_15)

## Aug

- The new service for LLM-based production is about 80% done. Also, spent time reading queue systems, mostly SQS.
- Got my hand dirty with AWS SDK, Redis, Docker for the brand new service. Also, learned a lot about writing production-ready Golang code.

## Jul

- Designed and implemented an LLM-based product ingestion service. Due to the latency of LLM inference, integrating this service with the existing product indexing pipeline would violate current SLA requirements.
- The new service is implemented in Golang (previously I want to use Python - but app size may affect service startup time). Some books helped me a lot:
    - [Test-driven development in Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121382396-test-driven-development-in-go).
    - [Cloud Native Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55767844-cloud-native-go).
    - [Learning Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55841848-learning-go).

## Jun

- On-device ML deployment: Upgrade our customized Mediapipe for the latest Unity (6.1) as well as the new SDK from Android & iOS. The in-house version is way too old and has many issues, I will probably need to fork mediapipe again and re-implement our SDKs.

- Develop a product summarizer service using ChatGPT. POC is easy, developing a production-ready service is not. The main challenge is the fact that LLM is not a "real-time" service, and to save cost, we may need to use Batch API. For that, a whole new service need to be developed, focusing on batch processing and handling race condition between database updates and batch processing.

  - [Algorithmic Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Thinking-2nd-Problem-Based-Introduction).

## Apr

- Finished both Cloud Computing & Text Mining courses. Both are practical and I pretty like them, although I wish I can spent more times on some topics taught in lectures.
- Worked on:
  - Non-English product search: adding non-English supports to the indexing backend and autocomplete services.
  - Synonym set support: It's more about allowing merchandisers to define their our product taxonomy, the most tricky part is how to adapt vector search to the customized definition from users w/o re-training models for each customer.

## Mar

- Spent a considerable effort to hunt down search bad cases reported by customers. Reproducing issues is easy, but actually pinning the root cause is a completely different story. Long story short, it is due to wrong expanding terms for sparse models.
- Developed new codebase for embedding finetuning. Loved [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) after completely switching to it. I also reported some bugs to [neural-cherche](https://github.com/raphaelsty/neural-cherche/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20author%3Adangkhoasdc). Still struggled to get good performance on Splade, SparseEmbed gave me some hope, but not much.

  - [Amazon Web Services in Action](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60828856-amazon-web-services-in-action-third-edition): Assisted in completing assignments.
  - [AI-Powered Search](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223393598-ai-powered-search):  Engaging read, though some chapters were slightly disappointing.
- Traveled to Bangkok: What a journey. Much fun, best food in SEA (aside from VN), and got scammed.
- Study:
  - Tried some event detection models and implemented event deduplication. I don't like the idea of using LLM for everything, but LLM actually is the best out-of-the-box solution for event detection.
  - Lots of coding for the other project: learned more about OpenAPI, FastAPI, mongoDB …

## Feb

- A lot of coding & hacking:
  - Developing backend services for sport facility recommendation.
  - Play around with event detection and knowledge graph construction.
