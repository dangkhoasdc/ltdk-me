title: "Review: Introduction to Recursive Programming"
---

It's a good book overall, but not outstanding.
The content is not treated evenly between chapters.
Nonetheless, there are some good chapters here and there:

- Chapter 1 and 2: The author does a good job introducing the concept of recursion intuitively with plenty of examples.
Using diagram to decompose and combine problems is a good technique for one new to recursion.
- Chapters 5 to 9: There is a wide range of examples and exercises on different types of recursion.
  Some of them are from interview questions, which is a plus.

It could be a great book if the author demonstrated more examples with better explanations on how to think recursively.
Specifically, I want more examples similar to what is done for the Fibonacci sequence.

Sometimes, especially in the later chapters, the author is too verbose in explaining the code line by line,
which makes the reading experience less enjoyable.

Python is used throughout the book, which is too easy for me.
So, I opted to explore [Raku](/posts/raku) instead while following the examples in the book.
Going back to the code examples, some are bad, particularly when the author uses lists to represent tree structures.
Drawing fractals using recursion is a nice touch, though. I wish the book had more.
The code for the recursive descent parser is too verbose for my taste.

Overall: 3.5/5. I definitely recommend some chapters of the book to newbies, but not the whole book.
