title: "Review: Introduction to Recursive Programming"
---

It's a good book overall, but not outstanding. The content are not treated evenly between chapters. Nonetheless, there are some good chapters here and there:

- Chapter 1&2: The author does a good job introducing the concept of recursion intuitively with plenty of examples.
Using diagram to decompose and combine the problem is a good technique for one who is new to recursion.
- Chapter 5 to 9: Plenty of good examples and exercises on different types of recursion. Some of them are from interview questions, which is a plus.

Sometimes, especially in the later chapters, the author is too verbose in explaining the code line by line, which makes the reading experience less enjoyable.

Python is used throughout the book, which is too easy for me. So, I opted to explore Raku instead while following the examples in the book.

Overall: 3.5/5. I definitely recommend some chapters of the book to newbies, but not the whole book.
